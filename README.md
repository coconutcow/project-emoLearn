## A computer vision solution to track facial expressions
## This tool can be utilized with standard video recordings or in real-time using just a webcam


Facial expressions are probably the best forms of non-verbal forms of expression, and being able to keep track of them using basic tools such as a webcam or standard video recordings can be utilized in a broad range of applications. With the right kind of features, one can extract meaningful information and insights.
In this implementation, I have trained a simple ML model which learns from the facial features (distance between the lips, angulation in the eyes and ears) to categorize two basic expressive features of **Smiling** and when one is in a **Bad Mood**

Below is a glimpse of the implementation
